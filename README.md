### Repository Title: 
**Customer Churn Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**

### Description:
This repository contains the code, data, and results for a project on predicting customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The goal of this project is to identify customers who are likely to leave a service provider, enabling the company to take proactive measures to retain them. The project utilizes a dataset from IBM Sample Data Sets, which includes various attributes about the customers, such as their services, account information, and demographics.

### Repository Structure:
- **`README.md`**: Provides an overview of the project, including the problem statement, approach, and results.
- **`data/`**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
  - `customer_churn.csv`
- **`notebooks/`**: Includes the Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
  - `01_data_exploration.ipynb`
  - `02_model_training.ipynb`
  - `03_model_evaluation.ipynb`
- **`models/`**: Stores the trained models and any saved checkpoints.
  - `customer_churn_ann_model.h5`
- **`scripts/`**: Contains Python scripts used for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
  - `data_preprocessing.py`
  - `train_model.py`
  - `predict_churn.py`
- **`results/`**: Stores the output of the model, including confusion matrices, accuracy scores, and other metrics.
  - `confusion_matrix.png`
  - `evaluation_metrics.txt`
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python libraries and dependencies needed to run the project.
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

### Key Features:
- **Data Exploration**: Analyze customer attributes, understand patterns, and visualize key insights.
- **Model Building**: Implementation of an ANN model using TensorFlow/Keras to predict customer churn.
- **Model Evaluation**: Confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to evaluate model performance.
- **Visualization**: Includes visual representations of the confusion matrix and other important metrics.

### Usage:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks or scripts to explore the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.

### Results:
The ANN model achieved a **79% accuracy** in predicting customer churn. The precision for class 0 (customers who did not churn) was **83%**, and for class 1 (customers who actually churned), it was **65%**.
